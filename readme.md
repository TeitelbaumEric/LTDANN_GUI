# LTDANN - Localized Temporarily Deployable Autonomous Navigation Network

LTDANN stands for Localized Temporarily Deployable Autonomous Navigation Network. It is a software application designed for the temporary deployment and monitoring of autonomous navigation networks. The application provides a user-friendly interface to initialize the network, check network health, and visualize the network in a 2D representation.

## Features

- Network Initialization: Configure the number of nodes and network size using an intuitive initialization screen.
- Network Health Monitoring: Monitor the health status of the network nodes, including RSSI and SNR values, in real-time.
- 2D Visualization: Visualize the autonomous navigation network in a 2D representation, displaying node positions, connections, and estimated object locations.
- Data Export: Export the collected data, including timestamps, node information, and estimated positions, to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Connect the necessary hardware components, such as sensors and microcontrollers.
4. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage

1. Launch the application and select the desired number of nodes and network size on the initialization screen.
2. Click the "Submit" button to proceed to the main screen.
3. Use the "Check Network Health" button to monitor the health status of the network nodes.
4. Click the "Visualize Network 2D" button to view the autonomous navigation network in a 2D representation.
5. Observe the estimated object locations and node connections in the visualization.
6. Export the collected data using the "Export Data" button for further analysis.
